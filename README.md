this is a small Tool that uses the Adafruit_Neopixel library (https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_NeoPixel) to control an LED strip connected to a raspberry pi
it also utilizes 2 motion sensors and a light sensor to start/stop some animation or color setting and set the brightness to higher values when light is detected
the animation can be done from begin to end or vice versa, based on which motion detection sensor is hit and since this was intended to be used for some stairway with different number of leds per step the number of leds can be configured inside the script as well as some other settings
it is not well documented or maintained in any way, i just guessed this could be useful for some people, and i will probably also answer some questions if asked politely ;)

there is no warranty for this
